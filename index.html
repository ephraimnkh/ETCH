						<p>
							So as you can already tell <i><b>ETCH</b></i> is a messenging app, but what makes this app different from all the others you find in your app store, well it's the fact that ETCH is all the apps on your app store but in one.<br> Yes, you read right it's all the apps in your app store but in one place.<br> We did this as we realized it does not make sense to change apps everytime you want to do something slightly different from what the one social media app does, so this approach results in no unnessary changing and a app where you can do everything in one place!

					<h2 title="Features of ETCH" id="shiftRight">Features of ETCH</h2>
					<section id="shiftUp">
							<h3 title="Find people and Contact them!">Find people and <i>"Contact"</i> them!</h3>
							Have you ever had the feeling "I wish I could contact this person but I don't have their phone number"?
							Well we have had that exact feeling too that is why with ETCH you can find that person by name and send a "Contact" request so that they can reveal their number at their discretion and you can instantly start	chatting as if you just got their number in person!

						 <h3 title="'ETCH Feed'"><i>"ETCH Feed"</i></h3>
							Feel like you missing out on what is happening in your contacts lives?<br>
							Well say goodbye to that feeling as now with ETCH - Messenger you get <i>"ETCH Feed".</i>
							What is <i>"ETCH Feed"</i> well this is the section of the app where you can <i>"Check"</i> what's 						happening with your contacts, whether it be profile picture/video updates, regular picture/video posts or an ETCH post.

							<h3 title="'Check' people out"><i>"Check"</i> people out</h3>
							Sometimes you can't make someone a contact - maybe you don't know them that well or they way more 						popular maybe even famous! - but that doesn't mean you can't <i>"Check"</i> what they post. You could simply send a <i>"Check"</i> request to the person and if they allow you can see what they post on your <i>"ETCH Feed"</i> as if they were your contact.

							<h3 title="'ETCH Page'"><i>"ETCH Page"</i></h3>
							Now what if you still missing the action of what someone is posting to the <i>"ETCH Feed"</i> well once again fear not for you can check their <i>"ETCH Page"</i> if they do want to share it with contacts or 						the public. The <i>"ETCH Page"</i> which many of you using other social media would be used to is a page where you can find all of a person's profile picture/video update history, regular posts or ETCH posts.

							<h3 title="'ETCH-all'(EA)"><i>"ETCH-all"(EA)</i></h3>
							Here's another amazing feature of ETCH, you can call anyone that is your contact right on ETCH!<br>
							Now you will probably saying we can already do that on our current messengers so what makes
							<i>"ETCH-all"</i> different. Well what makes <i>"ETCH-all"</i> different is that you are not able to
							only make voice calls but you can make video calls too with any of your contacts!.

							<h3 title="Photo/Video 'ETCHitor'"><i>Photo/Video "ETCHitor"</i></h3>
							Now another thing we find unnecessary is you having to switch apps to edit your photos/videos so
							with ETCH we made sure you can still stay in the app as there is an in house
							<i>Photo/Video "ETCHitor"</i> (Editor), meaning to enhance the photos/videos you post and send you 						don't have to swicth apps and import photos making life easier.

							<h3 title="Temporary Messages">Temporary Messages</h3>
							Sometimes you don't want messages, photos or videos to remain after your done with them and here at ETCH we know this so that is why we've provided the means for you to send temporary messages
							(Texts, Photos or Videos).<br><b>How is this done?</b><br>
							<ul>
								<li>Well you can either make a conversation temporary which means that after every text that is sent is read the text disappears after 5 minutes from when it was read the same goes for any photos or videos sent in this conversation.</li>
								<li>Or you can send a photo/video with a visibility time-limit on it that makes it delete on the 						receivers phone after the set time-limit is up.</li>
							</ul>
							Lastly when dealing with anything temporary if screenshots are taken the sending party will recieve a notification informing them that a screenshot has been taken, except for the case of temporary 						conversations where all parties of the conversation are informed of the screenshot being taken and by whom.

							<h3 title="Your Phone Number is you">Your Phone Number is you</h3>
							Here on ETCH messenger your phone number is your identification so to communicate with anyone all you
							need is their phone number and the other party to accept you as their <i>"Contact"</i>.
