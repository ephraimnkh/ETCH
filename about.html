				<p>
					Thank you for visting this section of the website this means you are interested in getting to know the
					creators of <i>ETCH - Messenger</i>.<br><br>
					We are a team under <i>MiEnd Inc</i> our parent company and we are currently we are based in South 						Africa. We are a passionate group of developers varying in age from late teens to late 20s and we are serious about creating services that are used daily such as <i>ETCH</i>, our slogan like our parent company is <i>Done Best<sup>TM</sup></i> meaning that whatever is being done has to be
					done to the best of the abilities of the team, so that you as the end user are extremely satisfied.<br>
				 	ETCH - Messenger is one of the products we are most proud of as we worked very long and hard on it, the idea for the app came about when some <i>MiEnd Inc</i> employees were tired of switching through many different apps just to find out what the same people are doing on each one, that's when
				 	<i>ETCH - Messenger</i> was born.
				 	As a team we love social networking just as much as you do and therefore since you love it we believe
				 	you want to improve your social networking experience so why not drop some suggestions for
				 	<i>ETCH</i> at our team email address: <a href="mailto:etchers931@gmail.com" target="_self" style="color:#fff"><address >etchers931@gmail.com</address></a><br>
				 	Just enter your details below. We'll try to make sure the app maintains Social Networking | Done Best<sup>TM</sup>
