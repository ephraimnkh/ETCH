				<h3>Can you message someone who is not your Contact?</h3>
				Yes, if you have their phone number you can message them directly, but if they have not accepted you as their "Contact" yet you will not be able to see anything they post or any profile pictures/videos they have.

				<h3>Can you still message someone if you do not have their number, after finding their profile by name?</h3>
				Yes, but only if the receiving party accepts the message request, which will allow the two to exchange messages but no profile pictures/videos or posts will be shown until the receiving party makes the sending party a "Contact", except for the cases where the receiving party has already made their posts public, in that case the only thing not visiable to the sender is profile pictures/videos.
